In this article, we will show you how to install a Cobra 3860 alarm system in your car.
 
## What You Need
 
Before you start the installation, make sure you have the following items:

- A Cobra 3860 alarm system kit, which includes the main unit, the siren, the remote control, the shock sensor, the LED indicator, the PIN code card, and the wiring harness.
- A Data Linker kit, which includes a USB cable, a software CD, and an interface module that allows you to program the alarm system according to your vehicle's specifications.
- A laptop or a PC with an internet connection and a USB port.
- A multimeter, a wire stripper, a soldering iron, some electrical tape, and some cable ties.

## Step 1: Access the Cobra Website
 
The first step is to access the Cobra website at www.cobra-at.com and log in with your user ID and password. Then, go to the professional area and enter your vehicle's information (make, model, year) and the product you want to install (Cobra 3860). The website will provide you with the installation solution for your specific case. You will need this information later when you program the alarm system with the Data Linker kit.
 
## Step 2: Install the Main Unit
 
The main unit is the brain of the alarm system. It receives signals from the remote control, the shock sensor, and the CAN/PLIP interface. It also controls the siren and the LED indicator. You need to install it in a hidden and secure location inside your vehicle. Here are some possible steps:

1. Disconnect the negative terminal of your car battery.
2. Find a suitable place for the main unit under the dashboard or behind the glove box. Make sure it is away from heat sources, moisture, and metal parts.
3. Secure the main unit with screws or cable ties.
4. Connect the wiring harness to the main unit according to the color code provided in the installation manual[^1^].
5. Route the wiring harness along the existing wiring of your vehicle and secure it with cable ties.
6. Connect the red wire of the wiring harness to a constant 12V power source (such as the battery or the fuse box).
7. Connect the black wire of the wiring harness to a good ground point (such as a metal bolt or screw).
8. Connect the blue wire of the wiring harness to an ignition-switched 12V power source (such as an accessory socket or an ignition fuse).
9. Connect the green wire of the wiring harness to a door switch signal (such as a courtesy light or a door lock).
10. Connect the white wire of the wiring harness to a parking light signal (such as a headlight switch or a tail light).
11. Connect any optional wires of the wiring harness according to your vehicle's features (such as central locking, electric windows, trunk release, etc.). Refer to your vehicle's wiring diagram for details.
