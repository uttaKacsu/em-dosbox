# How to Create Your Own Coat of Arms with Coat of Arms Design Studio Pro
 
If you are interested in creating your own coat of arms, you might want to check out Coat of Arms Design Studio Pro, a software that allows you to design and customize your own heraldic symbols. Coat of Arms Design Studio Pro is a Java program that runs on most computers (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux; but not phones/tablets) and has over 200 built-in creature and symbol charges, such as lions, crosses, owls, bears, fleur-de-lis, castles, etc. You can also use your own PNG and some SVG graphics as charges or supporters. Supporters are creatures, a helm and other decorations beside and above the shield. You can also add mantling, which is a cloth that hangs from the helm. You can choose from many ways to divide the shield and add ordinaries, which are simple designs such as bands across the shield. You can also give many ordinaries a number of decorative line styles, such as nebuly or engrailed. You can export your design as a PNG in an extremely large size.

Coat of Arms Design Studio Pro is not a free software, but you can download a free version that has most of the features except for adding supporters and mantling, importing PNG and some SVG graphics, and exporting in a larger size. The free version also gets needed graphics from the website, so there is a slight delay the first time you use a new creature or symbol. If you want to unlock the pro features and support further development, you can purchase a license code from the website[^1^]. The license code will be emailed to you within minutes and you can enter it in the software to activate the pro version.
 
Some people might be tempted to look for a coat of arms design studio pro torrent online, hoping to get the software for free without paying for a license code. However, this is not a good idea for several reasons. First of all, downloading torrents from unknown sources can be risky for your computer security, as they might contain viruses or malware that can harm your system or steal your personal information. Second, downloading torrents is illegal in many countries and can get you in trouble with the law if you are caught. Third, downloading torrents is unethical and unfair to the developers who spent time and effort creating the software and deserve to be compensated for their work. Therefore, we strongly advise you not to look for a coat of arms design studio pro torrent online and instead purchase a license code from the official website[^1^]. This way, you can enjoy the full features of the software without any risks or regrets.
 
If you are ready to create your own coat of arms with Coat of Arms Design Studio Pro, you can follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install the software from the website[^1^]. If you are using Windows, you can download the installer file and double-click it to install. If you are using Mac/Linux/Other systems, you will need to install Java first from [here](http://www.java.com/download/), then download the main file (coa.zip) and double-click it to launch.
2. Launch the software and enter your license code if you have purchased one. If not, you can use the free version with limited features.
3. Start designing your coat of arms by choosing a shield shape, division, tincture (color), charge (symbol), ordinary (simple design), line style (for ordinaries), supporter (creature or symbol beside or above the shield), mantling (cloth hanging from the helm), helm (headgear), crest (symbol on top of the helm), motto (phrase below the shield), etc. You can also import your own PNG or some SVG graphics as charges or supporters if you have the pro version.
