## Step 1: Download and Install Half-Life 2
 
If you don't own Half-Life 2 on Steam, you will need to download a cracked version of the game from a torrent site or a direct download link. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive, as the game is about 6 GB in size. Once you have downloaded the game, extract it to a folder of your choice and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen and install the game to your desired location.
 
## Step 2: Download and Install Synergy Mod
 
Next, you will need to download the latest full version of Synergy mod from Mod DB[^3^]. The file is about 200 MB in size and contains everything you need to play Synergy. Once you have downloaded the file, extract it to a folder of your choice and run the synergy.exe file. This will launch the Synergy launcher, which will allow you to configure your settings and join servers.
 
## Step 3: Join or Host a Server
 
Now that you have installed both Half-Life 2 and Synergy mod, you are ready to play co-op with your friends. You can either join an existing server or host your own server. To join a server, simply click on the "Find Servers" button on the Synergy launcher and browse through the list of available servers. You can filter by game mode, map name, ping, players, etc. To join a server, just double-click on it and wait for it to load.
 
To host your own server, click on the "Create Server" button on the Synergy launcher and choose your game mode, map name, max players, password, etc. You can also enable cheats, friendly fire, difficulty level, etc. To start your server, click on the "Start Server" button and wait for it to load. To invite your friends to your server, you will need to give them your IP address and port number. You can find these by typing "status" in the console (press ~ to open it).
