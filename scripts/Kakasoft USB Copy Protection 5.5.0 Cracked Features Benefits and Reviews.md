We are excited to announce the release of MeshLab 2021.07, the latest version of our open source system for processing and editing 3D triangular meshes. This version comes with several new features and improvements, including support for importing and exporting various file formats (\*.gltf, \*.glb, \*.nxs, \*.nxz, \*.e57) that are widely used in 3D graphics and scanning applications. Moreover, we have added a brand new plugin that allows you to perform exact mesh booleans operations, such as union, intersection and difference, on complex meshes with arbitrary topology. You can download MeshLab 2021.07 from the download section of our website, or from the github release page where you can also find the source code and the changelog.

MeshLab 2021.07 is the result of more than a year of development and testing by our team and the MeshLab community. We would like to thank all the contributors who submitted bug reports, feature requests, code patches and feedback on our github repository and our forum. Your support and collaboration are essential for the improvement and maintenance of MeshLab.
  
One of the main goals of this release was to enhance the compatibility and interoperability of MeshLab with other 3D software and hardware. We have added support for several file formats that are commonly used for storing and exchanging 3D models, such as glTF, Nexus and E57. These formats allow you to import and export meshes with attributes, textures, materials, animations and point clouds. You can also use MeshLab to convert between different formats and optimize your meshes for different purposes.
  
Another important feature of this release is the new plugin for exact mesh booleans. This plugin implements a robust and efficient algorithm for computing boolean operations on meshes with arbitrary topology, including non-manifold and self-intersecting meshes. You can use this plugin to create complex shapes by combining simple ones, or to perform operations such as cutting, drilling, hollowing and trimming on your meshes. The plugin also provides options for controlling the output mesh quality and preserving the input mesh attributes.

MeshLab 2021.07 also includes many other improvements and bug fixes that enhance the usability and stability of MeshLab. Some of the notable changes are: a new option to merge visible layers into a single layer, a new filter to compute the convex hull of a mesh, a new filter to align two meshes based on a set of corresponding points, a new filter to smooth the mesh normals, a new option to export the mesh quality as a scalar field, and many more. You can find the full list of changes in the changelog file.
  
We hope that you will enjoy using MeshLab 2021.07 and that you will find it useful for your 3D projects. We are always open to suggestions and feedback from our users, so please feel free to contact us through our github repository or our forum.
