Etabs 9.7.3 is based on a 3D finite element method that can handle any type of geometry and loading condition. You can create models using point, line, area, and solid elements, and assign them various material properties and section shapes. You can also define boundary conditions, supports, hinges, releases, and springs to control the degrees of freedom of your model.
 
One of the advantages of Etabs 9.7.3 is that it can automatically generate the analysis model from the physical model, saving you time and effort. You can also modify the analysis model manually if you want to change the mesh size, element type, connectivity, or stiffness. You can view the analysis results in various formats, such as tables, graphs, diagrams, animations, and reports. You can also export the results to other software or formats for further processing or presentation.
 
Etabs 9.7.3 also has a powerful design module that can check and optimize your structures according to different design codes and standards. You can design steel, concrete, composite, or masonry structures using built-in databases of section shapes and material properties. You can also use the integrated graphical section designer to create custom sections and perform stress analysis. Etabs 9.7.3 can also design foundations, shear walls, columns, beams, braces, slabs, and decks using various methods and criteria.
