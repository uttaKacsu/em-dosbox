# MultiScatter v1.091: A Powerful Plug-in for 3ds Max
 
MultiScatter is a plug-in for 3ds Max that works with various rendering systems, such as V-Ray, Mental Ray, Corona and Octane. It allows you to create complex scenes with a large number of objects easily and quickly. You can use it to scatter objects on surfaces, along splines, or in volumes. You can also control the distribution, orientation, scale, color, and animation of the scattered objects using maps, expressions, or presets.

## Example 1: Scattering Grass on a Plane
 
In this example, we will use MultiScatter to scatter grass on a plane. We will use a VRayProxy object as the source for the grass, and a bitmap as the distribution map for the scattering.

1. Open the scene file in 3ds Max.
2. Create a VRayProxy object in the scene. You can use any proxy file that contains grass models, or you can download one from [VIZPARK](https://www.vizpark.com/shop/grass-kit-v2/) or [Chaos Group](https://www.vray.com/free-grass-and-fur/).
3. Select the VRayProxy object and go to Modify panel. Under Proxy Display, set Preview Type to Bounding Box and Display As to Points. This will reduce the viewport lag when working with large proxy files.
4. Create a MultiScatter object in the scene. Go to Create panel > Geometry > MultiScatter and click anywhere in the viewport.
5. Select the MultiScatter object and go to Modify panel. Under Source Objects, click Pick and select the VRayProxy object. You should see some points appear on the plane.
6. Under Distribution Parameters, set Distribution Type to Bitmap and click None next to Distribution Map. Choose a bitmap that has some variation in brightness, such as a noise map or a gradient map. This will control where the grass will appear on the plane.
7. Under Transform Parameters, adjust the Scale Min and Scale Max values to change the size of the grass. You can also adjust the Rotation Min and Rotation Max values to add some variation to the orientation of the grass.
8. Under Render Parameters, set Render Type to VRayProxy and click None next to Proxy File. Choose the same proxy file that you used for the VRayProxy object.
9. Render the scene using V-Ray. You should see some realistic grass scattered on the plane.

You can tweak the settings of MultiScatter and VRayProxy to achieve different results. For example, you can change the density of the grass by adjusting the Density value under Distribution Parameters. You can also change the color of the grass by adding a VRayMultiSubTex map to the Material slot under Render Parameters and assigning different colors to different IDs of the proxy file.
 
## Example 2: Scattering Trees Along a Spline
 
In this example, we will use MultiScatter to scatter trees along a spline. We will use Forest Pack objects as the sources for the trees, and a spline as the distribution path for the scattering.

1. Open the scene file in 3ds Max.
2. Create two Forest Pack objects in the scene. You can use any library that contains tree models, or you can download one from [iToo Software](https://www.itoosoft.com/freeplugins/forestpacklite) or [Chaos Group](https://www.vray.com/free-trees-and-plants/).
3. Select each Forest Pack object and go to Modify panel. Under Geometry, click Edit and choose some tree models from the library. Under Areas, click Add and choose Surface. Select the plane as the surface for scattering. Under Distribution, set Density Units to Items per Unit Area and adjust Density value to reduce or increase the number of trees.
4. Create a spline in the scene that follows a curved path on the plane. You can use any spline creation tool, such as Line or Arc.
5. Create a MultiScatter object in the scene. Go to Create panel > Geometry > MultiScatter and click anywhere in the viewport.
6. Select the MultiScatter object and go to Modify panel. Under Source Objects, click Pick Multiple and select both Forest Pack objects. You should see some points appear along 8cf37b1e13
