# How to Restore Image for Acer W510 from a Flash Drive
 
If you need to reinstall Windows on your Acer W510 tablet, you can use a flash drive with the recovery software that came with your device. This will allow you to restore your system to factory defaults, or to fix any issues that may prevent Windows from booting normally. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Copy all the files from the "System DVD", "Recovery DVD 1 of 1", and "Recovery DVD English Language Pack" (if you have it) to the root of your flash drive. Do not create separate folders for each disk, just copy the files directly.
2. Go into the BIOS/UEFI and set the USB port to boot before the HDD. You can access the BIOS/UEFI by pressing F2 when you see the Acer logo during startup. The USB port may be labeled as USB - HDD or something similar.
3. Restart your W510 and it should bring you to the Acer restore utility. Follow the prompts and choose the option that suits your needs. You can either restore your system to factory defaults, or keep your personal files and settings.
4. Wait for the process to complete. It may take some time depending on the size of your flash drive and the speed of your device. Do not turn off your tablet or remove the flash drive until it is done.
5. Once the restore is finished, you can remove the flash drive and restart your tablet. You may need to go through some initial setup steps, such as choosing your language, region, and network settings.

Congratulations! You have successfully restored your image for Acer W510 from a flash drive. You can now enjoy using your tablet as if it was new.
  
If you encounter any problems during the restore process, you can try some troubleshooting steps. For example, if the restore utility does not recognize your flash drive, you can try using a different USB port or a different flash drive. You can also check the BIOS/UEFI settings and make sure that the boot order is correct. If the restore utility asks you to insert disc 2 of 2, you can try turning off your tablet and restarting it. This may fix the issue and allow you to continue the restore.
