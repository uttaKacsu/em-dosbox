Avid Media Composer is one of the most popular and powerful video editing software in the industry, trusted by professional editors in every segment of movie making, television, broadcast, and streaming media. It offers native support for 2K, 4K, Ultra HD, and higher resolution media, as well as accelerated high-res and HD workflows, real-time collaboration, and powerful media management.
 
But what if you don't have a license to use this software? What if you want to try it out before buying it? What if you want to edit videos on your own computer without relying on the cloud or a subscription? Well, there is a way to do that: by using a crack file.

A crack file is a small program that modifies the original software to bypass its security features and allow you to use it without a license. It can be downloaded from various websites or torrent sites, such as [1337x](https://www.1337xx.to/torrent/4097600/Avid-Media-Composer-8-5-0-Multilingual-FileCR/). However, using a crack file is illegal and risky. It can expose your computer to viruses, malware, or spyware. It can also damage your system files or cause compatibility issues with other software. And it can get you in trouble with the law if you are caught.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using a crack file to edit videos with Avid Media Composer 8.5. Instead, we suggest you use the official trial version of the software, which you can download from [Avid's website](https://www.avid.com/media-composer). The trial version gives you access to all the features and functions of the software for 30 days. You can use it to edit videos like a pro and see if it suits your needs and preferences. After the trial period expires, you can either buy a license or uninstall the software.

This way, you can enjoy editing videos like a pro without any worries or risks.
  
In this article, we will show you some of the basic steps to edit videos with Avid Media Composer 8.5. We will assume that you have already installed the software and have a video file that you want to edit. If you don't have a video file, you can download some sample footage from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/videos/) or [Videvo](https://www.videvo.net/).
 
## Step 1: Create a project
 
The first thing you need to do is to create a new project in Avid Media Composer. To do that, open the software and click on "Create Project" on the start screen. You will see a window where you can name your project, choose a format, and set other options. For this example, we will name our project "Tutorial" and choose "1080p/23.976" as the format. You can also choose a location for your project files on your computer. Click on "Create" when you are done.
 
## Step 2: Import your video file
 
The next thing you need to do is to import your video file into your project. To do that, go to the "File" menu and select "Input" > "Source Browser". You will see a window where you can browse your computer and find your video file. For this example, we will use a video file called "Beach.mp4". Select your video file and click on "Import". You will see a progress bar as the software imports your video file and creates a media clip in your project.
 
## Step 3: Edit your video
 
The last thing you need to do is to edit your video according to your vision and preferences. To do that, go to the "Edit" workspace by clicking on the icon at the bottom left corner of the screen. You will see three main panels: the Project panel, where you can see your media clips and bins; the Timeline panel, where you can arrange and trim your clips; and the Composer panel, where you can preview and play back your clips.
 
To edit your video, you need to drag and drop your media clip from the Project panel to the Timeline panel. You can use the tools at the bottom of the Timeline panel to cut, move, or adjust your clip. You can also add transitions, effects, titles, or audio tracks by using the tools at the top of the screen. You can preview and play back your clip by using the buttons at the bottom of the Composer panel.
 
You can edit your video as much as you want until you are satisfied with the result. You can also save your project by going to the "File" menu and selecting "Save Project".
 
## Step 4: Export your video
 
The final step is to export your video as a new file that you can share or upload online. To do that, go to the "File" menu and select "Output" > "Export". You will see a window where you can choose a name, a location, and a format for your new video file. For this example, we will name our new video file "Tutorial.mp4" and choose "H.264" as the format. You can also adjust other settings such as resolution, frame rate, or quality by clicking on "Options". Click on "Save" when you are done.
 
You will see a progress bar as the software exports your new video file. When it is finished, you can find your new video file in the location that you chose. You can then play it with any media player or upload it to any platform that supports it.
