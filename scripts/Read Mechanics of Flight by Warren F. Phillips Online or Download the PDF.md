Mechanics of Flight is a textbook written by Warren F. Phillips, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Utah State University. The book covers the principles of flight mechanics through worked examples and progressive problem solving. It also presents the theory and applications of aerodynamics and propulsion, as well as the general equations of motion, dynamic stability, aircraft handling qualities, and flight simulation.
 
The book is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in aerospace engineering, as well as practicing engineers and test pilots who want to master the science and mathematics of flight mechanics. The book has a unique balance of breadth and depth, coupled with a comprehensive presentation of both classical and modern techniques. The book also features more than 300 illustrations and 500 homework problems.

The second edition of the book, published in 2009, includes new and updated material on topics such as nonlinear aerodynamics, stall and spin recovery, hypersonic flight, rocket propulsion, orbital mechanics, and more. The book also comes with an instructor's companion site that contains solutions to selected problems, PowerPoint slides, and MATLAB codes.
 
Mechanics of Flight is available in hardcover format from Wiley[^2^], as well as in PDF format from Archive[^1^]. The book has received positive reviews from readers and instructors who praised its clarity, rigor, relevance, and pedagogy.
  
The book is organized into 12 chapters, each covering a major topic in flight mechanics. The first chapter provides an overview of aerodynamics, including the concepts of fluid statics, boundary layer, potential flow, airfoil theory, finite wing theory, and compressible flow. The second chapter gives an overview of propulsion, including the principles of thrust, efficiency, specific impulse, and performance of various types of engines. The third chapter introduces the general equations of motion for a rigid body in three dimensions, and discusses the concepts of reference frames, coordinate systems, and kinematics.

The fourth chapter deals with aircraft performance, including the analysis of steady and accelerated flight, range and endurance, climb and descent, takeoff and landing, and turning flight. The fifth chapter covers static stability and control, including the definitions and criteria of stability and trim, the effects of control surfaces and high-lift devices, and the methods of longitudinal and lateral-directional static stability analysis. The sixth chapter discusses dynamic stability and response, including the concepts of modes, damping, frequency, and time constants, as well as the methods of longitudinal and lateral-directional dynamic stability analysis.
 
The seventh chapter focuses on aircraft handling qualities, including the definitions and requirements of flying qualities, the effects of stability and control derivatives, the evaluation of handling qualities using various criteria and methods, and the design of flight control systems. The eighth chapter introduces flight simulation, including the principles and techniques of modeling and simulation, the components and architecture of a flight simulator, and the applications of flight simulation for training and research. The ninth chapter extends the analysis to nonlinear aerodynamics, including the phenomena of stall, separation, shock waves, vortex breakdown, and unsteady aerodynamics.
