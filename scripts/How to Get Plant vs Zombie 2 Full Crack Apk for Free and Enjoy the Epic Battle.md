- Use the Zen Garden. The Zen Garden is a feature that allows you to grow and collect plants that can give you extra coins, gems, or boosts. You can access it from the main menu and plant the sprouts that you get from playing the levels. You can also buy more sprouts with coins or gems. To make your plants grow faster, you need to water them, play music for them, or use plant food on them. Once they are fully grown, you can collect their rewards by tapping on them.
- Save up your plant food. Plant food is a powerful resource that can enhance your plants' abilities and unleash devastating attacks on the zombies. You can get plant food from glowing green zombies, from certain plants like the Tile Turnip or the Power Lily, or from buying them with gems. However, plant food is limited and you can only store up to three at a time (unless you have the Plant Food Storage upgrade). Therefore, you should save your plant food for critical moments or for boss battles. You can also use plant food strategically on different plants to create different effects.
- Know your plants and zombies. Plant vs Zombie 2 features a huge variety of plants and zombies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. You should familiarize yourself with their abilities and behaviors, so you can choose the best plants for each level and counter the zombies' attacks. For example, you should use Wall-nuts or Infi-nuts to block the zombies' path, use Snapdragons or Laser Beans to hit multiple zombies in a row, use Bonk Choys or Spikeweeds to deal with armored zombies, use Iceberg Lettuces or Winter Melons to slow down the zombies, and so on. You should also pay attention to the zombies' special traits, such as their speed, health, immunity, weapons, or abilities.
